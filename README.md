# heart-disease-prediction
Project for the course of *Mathematical Statistics*.
We built a series of models with the goal to predict if a patient, given a series of parameters, has an heart disease.

In the data folder you can find the dataset. The file named *Pilot_Project.pdf* is the report that was written about the work done. In the latter one can find the plot of the graphs present in the R code.
